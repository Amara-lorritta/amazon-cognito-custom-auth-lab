# amazon-cognito-custom-auth-lab

This project demonstrates a serverless custom authentication flow using Amazon Cognito, AWS Lambda, and Amazon CloudWatch. It was completed as part of a hands-on AWS lab to build a secure and flexible user login authentication process.

## üß© Lab Objectives
- ‚úÖ Configured an Amazon Cognito user pool.
- ‚úÖ Created Lambda functions for custom authentication flow:
  - `DefineAuthFunction`
  - `AuthFunction`
  - `AuthChallengeResponseFunction`
- ‚úÖ Integrated the flow with CloudWatch Logs for observability.
- ‚úÖ Successfully tested the authentication lifecycle.

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aedc1352-d5f6-4bb0-931b-c60cd9d99fbf)

The solution uses three Lambda functions triggered in sequence by Amazon Cognito:
1. **DefineAuthChallenge** ‚Äì Initiates the custom challenge
2. **CreateAuthChallenge** ‚Äì Generates and issues a verification code
3. **VerifyAuthChallengeResponse** ‚Äì Verifies the user‚Äôs response
4. All Lambda function activity is logged and monitored using **Amazon CloudWatch**.

## üìÇ Tech Stack

- Amazon Cognito  
- AWS Lambda (Python 3.13)  
- Amazon CloudWatch  

## üöÄ How It Works

1. User initiates login through the Cognito user pool.
2. Cognito triggers the first Lambda (`DefineAuthFunction`) to start a `CUSTOM_CHALLENGE`.
3. The second Lambda (`AuthFunction`) generates a code challenge for the user.
4. The user responds with the code verified by the third Lambda (`AuthChallengeResponseFunction`).
5. All responses and outcomes are tracked in CloudWatch.
